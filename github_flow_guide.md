Understanding the GitHub flow
======

Create a branch.
------

Add commits.
------

Open a Pull Request.
------

Discuss and review your code.
------

Deploy.
------

With GitHub, you can deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging to main.

Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing main branch into production.

Different teams may have different deployment strategies. For some, it may be best to deploy to a specially provisioned testing environment. For others, deploying directly to production may be the better choice based on the other elements in their workflow.
